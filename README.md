# Mathart
This repo is a collection of different math-art work done through different functional data creation and transformations. 
The work was inspired by Marcus [https://github.com/marcusvolz/mathart] is his incredible mathart work. My target is learn creation of elegant artwork and become an expart in the field. 

*I will focus on a number of mathematical transformations such as:
--
- Log transformations
- use of trigonometric functions
- among others
